/*Canada Cosmos Control has received a report of another incident. They believe that an alien has illegally entered our space. A person who witnessed the appearance of the alien has come forward to describe the alienâ€™s appearance. It is your role within the CCC to determine which alien has arrived. There are only 3 alien species that we are aware of, described below:

TroyMartian, who has at least 3 antenna and at most 4 eyes;
VladSaturnian, who has at most 6 antenna and at least 2 eyes;
GraemeMercurian, who has at most 2 antenna and at most 3 eyes.*/

/*The first line contain the number of antenna that the witness claimed to have seen on the alien. 
The second line contain the number of eyes seen on the alien.*/

/*The output will be the list of aliens who match the possible description given by the witness.
If no aliens match the description, there is no output.*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int num_antenna;
    int num_eyes;

    scanf("%d",&num_antenna);
    scanf("%d",&num_eyes);

    if ((num_antenna>=3)&&(num_eyes<=4))
    {
        printf("TroyMartian\n");
    }

    if ((num_antenna<=6)&&(num_eyes>=2))
    {
        printf("VladSaturnian\n");
    }

    if ((num_antenna<=2)&&(num_eyes>=2))
    {
        printf("GraemeMercurian");
    }

    return 0;
